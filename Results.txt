- What are some problems that React can solve for us?
    React is able to create buttons with their own functions without the need of
    adding event listeners for every button that is created and located. We can
    also use useState for important variables that are constantly being changed
    throughout the run-through of the website.
    Another thing that react can solve is to remove the necessity of loops that
    handle the rerendering of DOM items. React will handle the rendering accordingly.
